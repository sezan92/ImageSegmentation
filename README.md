## Detecting Left Ventrical from MRI Scans using Deep Learning
In this Project I have tried to solve the Image Segmation problem on a Medical Dataset , i.e MRI SCANS of Hearts. The project is inspired by the kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/details/deep-learning-tutorial). I have used their data. For the dataset , you have to download it from sunnybrooks dataset by registering.
