## Detecting Left Ventrical from MRI Scans using Deep Learning
In this Project I have tried to solve the Image Segmation problem on a Medical Dataset , i.e MRI SCANS of Hearts. The project is inspired by the kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/details/deep-learning-tutorial). I have used their data. For the dataset , you have to download it from sunnybrooks dataset by registering. The Image shows the result. The left Images are the MRI scans. The Middle images show the Left Ventricles labeled in the scan. The Right most images show the Result of the Deep Learning Classifier. ![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sezan92/ImageSegmentation/master/Labeled.png)
